## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

Just a simple website for a cafe made for a simple and clean user experience.

## Optimizations:

I would improve this project by adding more animations but nothing too large to hinder loading times. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned the importance of Separation of Concerns. Having unorganized code is crippling and hinders workflow.
