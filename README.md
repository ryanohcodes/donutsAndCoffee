# Donuts and Coffee
This my work for a coffee and donut shop. 

**Link to project:** https://coffeeanddonuts.netlify.app/


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Just a simple website for a cafe made for a simple and clean user experience.

## Optimizations:

I would improve this project by adding more animations but nothing too large to hinder loading times. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned the importance of Separation of Concerns. Having unorganized code is crippling and hinders workflow.
